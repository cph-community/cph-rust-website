# About

A place for aspiring and experienced Rust enthusiasts to come together to discover and discuss the latest Rust developments, showcase Rust projects and crates, network and meet each other in a supportive community. ðŸ¦€ðŸ§¡

We meet on a monthly basis somewhere in Copenhagen and are open to everyone interested in learning more about Rust, even if you have no prior experience with the language.
