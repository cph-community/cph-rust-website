<p>We are excited to invite you to:</p>
<p>Rust Hack Night #3: Embedded on Espressif's ESP32C3</p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> Thursday March 7, 2024 at 17:00 to 22:00<br>
<strong>Location:</strong> Veo Technologies, Rovsingsgade 68, 2100 Copenhagen</p>
<p>This night we code bare-metal Rust on Espressif's ESP32C3 microcontroller. We will have a workshop-style format where people can do their own thing, or ask for help. We encourage participants to be familiar with Rust or embedded, but not necessarily both.</p>
<p>Our generous sponsors for this hack night are:</p>
<ul class="pl-5 list-disc mb-4">
<li><strong><a href="https://www.espressif.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Espressif Systems</a></strong>, makers of the ESP32, have sponsored 25 dev kits that will be raffled to participants for use during the workshop and take home after.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://veo.co" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Veo Technologies</a></strong>, makers of live-streaming cameras for sports events, and employers of embedded software developers in Copenhagen, have offered their offices as venue, and will be sponsoring nutrients during the hack night.</li>
</ul>
<p>We would like to gather the cool projects made on a shared repository so that others around the world will find it easier to work with ESP32. So if you know what pet project you want to work on, and intend for it to be open source, then do think about committing your work to git for later sharing.</p>
<p><strong>## Program</strong></p>
<p>17:00 - 17:10: Finding a seat<br>
17:10 - 17:30: Welcome, sponsor intro<br>
17:20 - 21:30: std::iter::from_fn(hack);<br>
21:30 - 21:55: Show and tell, evaluate<br>
21:55 - 22:00: core::mem::drop(presence);</p>
<p>Nutrients will be streamed during the event with a peak dosage at around 18:00.</p>
<p><strong>## Seats and raffle</strong></p>
<p>Since Espressif Systems give away free hardware to participants, we care to minimize no-shows. For that reason, we kindly ask that you revisit your RSVP status if you cannot attend.</p>
<p>- There are 50 raffle seats. This means if you get a seat, you get to share one dev kit with someone else, and you get to enter the raffle to bring it home.<br>
- BYOB (Bring Your Own Board): If you are the lucky owner of an ESP32 board, and you're already bootstrapped to participate without raffling, you can write to us (simon@simonshine.dk) and we can fit you in.</p>
<p>Since the Veo Technologies venue is very big, we don't expect to reach the fire regulation limit, so we provide another option for participating:</p>
<p>- You just want to say hi: Feel free to come by and see what's going on. All you have to do here is write a comment on the invitation to say you're thinking of coming. This ticket does not involve active coding or food.</p>

<p class="">Couldn't make the Rust meetup because all the seats were taken? As a supplement to the wildly popular monthly Copenhagen Rust meetups, coding night means less chat, more code. Each coding night has a theme under which people are free to explore. You can show up with an existing project within the theme, or you can show up barehanded and start from scratch.</p>
<p class="">This time we're looking at: Leptos, a reactive wasm web-framework that lets you write Rust in the browser. You can get a head start with Leptos: https://leptos.dev/</p>
<p class="">Towards the end of the coding night we have allocated a short amount of time for show-and-tell in case you have something you want to show off. Others are free to continue their thing simultaneously, this is just inspirational.</p>

<p>After a long hiatus, we are starting up again with Rust hack nights. Our first meeting of 2018 will feature a presentation titled <b>Rust and Fuzz Testing</b>, delivered by the good folks at <a href="https://seasoned.software" target="_blank">Seasoned.Software</a>:</p>

<blockquote style="font-style: italic">At <a href="https://seasoned.software" target="_blank">Seasoned.Software</a> we build a CI platform that uses fuzz testing to improve the quality of your software projects. We love Rust and we use it for most of our platform, and we support Rust projects as first class citizens. We will give a brief presentation on how Rust helped us build our platform, which problems we have encountered so far, and how we solved them. Afterwards we will explain why you should fuzz test your own projects and show how to set up fuzz testing for your own Rust projects.</blockquote>
